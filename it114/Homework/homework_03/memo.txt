1. How did the process of creating these programs go for you?

2. What were your main challenges and how did you overcome them?

3. What did you learn that may be of use as you move along in this class?

----------------------------------------------------------------

1. creating the program was fairly easy and straightforward for me since
I have some java experience already.

2. I found that my main challenges were the long and short variables as I haven't
seen or used them in a while.

3. The long and short variables were definitely a helpful refresher as well as a refresher
on how to switch values between variables.
