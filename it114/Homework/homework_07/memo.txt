1. How did the process of creating these programs go for you?

2. What were your main challenges and how did you overcome them?

3. What did you learn that may be of use as you move along in this class?

----------------------------------------------------------------

1. The process of creating this program went well. I got hung up on a couple of
the questions but was able to worth through them after testing a few different things.

2. My main challenges were figuring out if what I just coded was working properly. Since
it doesn't always return a value, it wasn't as easy to tell if what I did was working.

3. Learning how to properly implement nested loops in a program is helpful as well as being
comfortable with loops in general.
