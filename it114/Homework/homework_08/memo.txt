1. How did the process of creating these programs go for you?

2. What were your main challenges and how did you overcome them?

3. What did you learn that may be of use as you move along in this class?

----------------------------------------------------------------

1. The process of creating this program went okay. I got hung up on a implementing "tryAgain"
and found myself having pretty disorganized code.

2. My main challenge was figuring out how to properly implement "tryAgain" but after enough testing and 
chipping away at it little by little, I was able to get it working.

3. Learning how to properly format my loops and update/print variables will be useful.
